# Flutter Flavour boilerplate code 

Hi !!! Everyone I have created this repository to help everyone setup the flavors in flutter in 5 easy steps.

> **If you you like this code please star this repository and show your support**


## Step 1

- Clone this repository

- rename the folder **(i.e. flavourboilerplate)** to your **app name**

- Open the folder in **vscode** and search for **flavourboilerplate**  and replace each instance with your **app name**

- Replace the *development_icon.png*,*staging_icon.jpg*,*production_icon.jpg* with your app icon image 

**IMPORTANT:** Follow the same naming pattern for images

## Step 2:  Android Setup

- open the *build.gradle* in the *android/app/* folder

- replace **APP_NAME_PRODUCTION**, **APP_NAME_STAGING**, **APP_NAME_DEVELOPMENT** with your app's name

## Step 3:  IOS Setup

- open the *Runner.xcworkspace* in **XCODE** 

- double click on the **Runner** file in the target and change the display name **APP NAME** to your app name

- search for **APP_DISPLAY_NAME** and rename the **APP NAME** for all the schemes

- search for **Product Bundle Identifier** and rename the package name 

 > NOTE: If you have replaced all **flavourboilerplate** with your app name in the first step this will be replaced automatically
